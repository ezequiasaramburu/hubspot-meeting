## Implementation Summary

Implemented a meeting processing functionality in the `worker.js` file that connects to real HubSpot API:

- **Added meeting support to Domain schema** - Extended `lastPulledDates` to include meetings tracking
- **Created `processMeetings` function** - Following the same pattern as contacts and companies
- **Implemented Meeting Created/Updated actions** - Based on creation vs modification dates
- **Added contact email association** - Meetings are linked to contact emails via HubSpot Associations API
- **Contact Email Linking** - Each meeting action includes the email of associated contacts

## Features Implemented

- **Meeting Properties Captured**: meeting_id, meeting_title, meeting_body, meeting_start_time, meeting_end_time, meeting_created_date, meeting_last_modified_date
- **Action Types**: "Meeting Created" and "Meeting Updated" based on creation vs modification date comparison (within 1 hour = Created, beyond 1 hour = Updated)
- **Contact Association**: Uses HubSpot's `/crm/v3/associations/MEETINGS/CONTACTS/batch/read` API to link meetings to contacts
- **Email Resolution**: Fetches contact emails via batch API calls to `/crm/v3/objects/contacts/batch/read`

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

- **Invalid API Filter Operators**: The original `generateLastModifiedDateFilter` function used "GTQ"/"LTQ" operators which are invalid in HubSpot API, causing 400 validation errors and request timeouts. Fixed by changing to "GTE"/"LTE".

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Code Quality and Readability

- **Extract configuration constants**: Move retry counts, timeouts, and batch sizes to a config object
- **Add comprehensive error types**: Create custom error classes for different API failure scenarios
- **Implement proper logging**: Replace console.log with structured logging (winston/bunyan)
- **Add input validation**: Validate domain objects and API responses before processing
- **Create shared utilities**: Extract common patterns like retry logic and date filtering into reusable functions

### 2. Project Architecture

- **Separate concerns**: Split worker.js into separate modules for each data type (contacts, companies, meetings)
- **Implement dependency injection**: Make HubSpot client and database dependencies injectable for better testing
- **Create data models**: Define TypeScript interfaces or schemas for HubSpot objects
- **Implement queue management**: Use Redis or similar for job queuing in production environments

### 3. Code Performance

- **Implement parallel processing**: Process contacts, companies, and meetings concurrently instead of sequentially
- **Add intelligent batching**: Optimize batch sizes based on API rate limits and response times
- **Add circuit breakers**: Prevent cascading failures when external APIs are down
- **Use streaming**: For large datasets, implement streaming processing instead of loading everything in memory
- **Optimize association lookups**: Use bulk association APIs more efficiently and cache results
